\title{Draw an image}
\usage{
draw_image(image, x = 0, y = 0, width = 1, height = 1, scale = 1,
  clip = "inherit", interpolate = TRUE, hjust = 0, vjust = 0)
}
\arguments{
\item{image}{The image to place. Can be a file path, a URL, or a raw vector with image data,
as in \code{magick::image_read()}. Can also be an image previously created by \code{magick::image_read()} and
related functions.}

\item{x}{The x location of the image. (Left side if \code{hjust = 0}.)}

\item{y}{The y location of the image. (Bottom side if \code{vjust = 0}.)}

\item{width}{Width of the image.}

\item{height}{Height of the image.}

\item{scale}{Scales the image relative to the rectangle defined by \code{x}, \code{y}, \code{width}, \code{height}. A setting
of \code{scale = 1} indicates no scaling.}

\item{clip}{Set to "on" to clip the image relative to the box into which it is draw (useful for \code{scale > 1}).
Note that clipping doesn't always work as expected, due to limitations of the grid graphics system.}

\item{interpolate}{A logical value indicating whether to linearly interpolate the image
(the alternative is to use nearest-neighbour interpolation, which gives a more blocky result).}

\item{hjust}{Horizontal justification relative to x.}

\item{vjust}{Vertical justification relative to y.}
}
\description{
Places an image somewhere onto the drawing canvas. By default, coordinates run from
0 to 1, and the point (0, 0) is in the lower left corner of the canvas. Requires the \code{magick}
package to work, and fails gracefully if that package is not installed.
